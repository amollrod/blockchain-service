# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/PackageTraceability.ts --network sepolia
PackageTraceabilityModule#PackageTraceability - 0x1751CDe175953C9a7c4A0c7625c97217368f343E
```
